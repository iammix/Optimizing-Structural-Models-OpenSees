# Optimizing-Structural-Models-OpenSees
Optimization is a sense, a process, a method which everybody uses even automatically very often in everyday life. From choosing the shortest route in order to get to our destination, the way of managing and distributing material in our disposition, the qualitative or quantitative cost assessment in relation to the value of a product or a service, to the solution of complex problems in various scientific domains. In the field of Structural Engineering is well known that many issues needed to be optimized. The objective of this thesis is the development of a Python-Based Framework that optimizes the response of concrete plain models. The methodology that is used to develop the framework is based on the Theory of Differential Evolution Algorithms. The plain models are developed with OpenSees and they are taken into consideration the Soil-Structure-Interaction for every type of footing.
